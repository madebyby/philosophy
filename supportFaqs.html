            <p>we are actively sourcing products and services in an ethical, sustainable and socially conscious way. we require our supply chain partners to demonstrate their responsible practices through expert third party assessments and audits. for ingredients that face greater sustainability risks, we go further by working with certifiers, sector-wide collaborations and pursuing traceability. business partners must also comply with our code of conduct - which sets out Coty’s minimum standards including human and labour rights, environmental protection, and anti-corruption.</p>
