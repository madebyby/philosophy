        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>ARBITRATION</h3>
          <b>You and philosophy Agree to Arbitrate.</b>
          <p>You and philosophy agree that any and all claims arising from or relating to these Terms or any good or service provided by us to you and/or the person or entity you represent shall be subject to binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). This includes claims based on contract, tort, equity, statute, or otherwise, as well as claims regarding the scope and enforceability of this provision. It includes all claims by or against you, us, and/or others providing or receiving any product or service related to these Terms or your purchase(s) or transaction(s) with us. However, at the election of any party, any claims subject to the jurisdiction of a small claims court are not required to be arbitrated; nor are claims for injunctive relief to protect intellectual property rights.</p>
          <b>Arbitration Procedures.</b>
          <p>A single, neutral arbitrator shall decide all claims and shall render a final, binding written decision pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules & Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which rules are found at www.adr.org.  In the arbitration proceeding, the parties shall be entitled to conduct only essential discovery, as determined by the arbitrator, which is adequate to prove the claims or defenses at issue, but in no event will discovery be allowed that is greater than that permitted by the State of New York Rules of Civil Practice Law and Rules.</p>
          <p>Each party to the arbitration shall pay his, her, or its own costs of arbitration, unless otherwise required by the relevant arbitration rules.  If you cannot afford your arbitration costs, you may apply for a waiver under the relevant rules. </p>
          <b>Class Action Waiver.</b>
          <p>Each party waives any right to bring representative claims on behalf of a class of individuals or entities or on behalf of the general public or a consolidation with other arbitrations (the “class action waiver”). The arbitration provision may be severed or modified if necessary to render it enforceable.  For example, if a California court determines that this class action waiver is not enforceable to the extent it prohibits any right to public injunctive relief, if any, all other claims subject to arbitration shall be arbitrated under this provision, with a court to decide any claim for public injunctive relief.</p>
          <b>Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</b>
          <p>You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing philosophy at customercare@philosophy.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) Your Address; (3) Your Phone Number; and (4) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms. This opt-out notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the Website.</p>
